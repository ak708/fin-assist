# Inspiration
Our team has personally invested in many financial ventures and experienced many losses. Mainly because we didn't have a proper way of knowing if our decisions were right.

This led us to build this idea which we believed would be a better way for beginners to understand and safely experiment with many forms of investment.

# What it does
the project aims to create a single-user interface for all your 
basic financial needs. It has a live price tracker that helps you keep up to date
with the latest prices so that you can make an educated decision
on what you want to invest in.

# How we built it
The project was built using the MERN stack

- ReactJS used to make the UI - make the navbar, the price tiles, the menus, etc
- MongoDB is used for data storage and database - we connected the database to take in login details and personalize the experience
- GitHub was used to hold the code
- GitHub Pages was used to host the website
- ChartJS was used to plot the graphs for the currencies
- RapidAPI was used to handle requests by fetching data according to user requests
- Axios used as a client
- GoDaddy was used to create a nice website address for our product

# Challenges we faced
During this journey, we faced a lot of difficulties
- APIs integration proved to be a hassle 
- Integration of AI with our project proved to be very difficult due to the lack of time and proper data
- It wasn't easy to set the DNS for our GitHub page to a GoDaddy domain

# Accomplishments that we are proud of
- We were able to implement the API successfully
- We were able to use the domain from GoDaddy properly
- The issue with the DNS between GoDaddy and Github Pages was solved 
- Even though we were in a time shortage, we pulled through and finished the project and we felt our results were much beyond expectations


# What we learned
- We learned how to build a project from start to finish and how vital a proper timeline is
- Thanks to many open-source technologies, we were able to implement all that we imagined without much trouble
- We learned how to properly implement many web technologies 
- We learned the importance of teamwork and how essential it is to build anything
- We learned the creation of web Apps using ReactJS, using ChartJS to plot graphs
- using GitHub pages to host the web app and using Axios as an HTTP client

# What's next for the project
- As finance enthusiasts ourselves, we believe that financial knowledge should be shared and must be helpful to others
- We wish for our software to reach the hands of many beginners and experienced enthusiasts so that they can be benefitted too
- We further wish to successfully implement our ML Expense Tracker model that can tell the user plausible investments and deposits that can help the user achieve their financial goals
- We further wish to make the ML model predict the future prices of investments so that educated guesses can be made and the user can achieve goals.
